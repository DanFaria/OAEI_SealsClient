SEALS OMT Client 6.3 (OAEI 2016)

*** Changes from version 6.2 (OAEI 2015) ***

> The "batch mode" option, "-z", is now available in the "-o" mode
  in addition to the "-x" mode.

> A new parameter, "-f FILE_PATH", is now available in "-o" mode,
  allowing the specification of the file where the output alignment
  is to be saved.

> A new class "eu.sealsproject.omt.client.interactive.Mapping" has
  been added to the Client, to be used when querying the Oracle, in
  interactive matching mode. A "Mapping" can be constructed from
  the URLs of the source and target terms, plus their relation, in
  either String form, or as an instance of the Relation enum.

> A new method, check(Set<Mapping>) has been added to the Oracle
  to simulate the case of a user being asked to pick between
  "conflicting" mappings for the same class(es), such as: <A = C>,
  <A = D>, <B = C>. In such a case, choosing between the mappings
  requires a lot less effort from the user than reviewing them
  independently. Thus, when given a set of at most 3 mappings, the
  method will count one less interaction for each entity shared
  by the mappings (to a minimum of one interaction). However, it
  must be noted that the method imposes no restriction whatsoever
  on the input set of mappings - it will accept any number of them
  and they need not be conflicting; it will simply treat them as
  independent requests for all intents and purposes, unless the
  criteria above are met (at most 3 mappings sharing entities). 
  Thus, systems can use the method for the sake of convenience, to
  ask about multiple mappings at once, even if they aren't related
  (e.g., in the case of logical conflicts); but they will gain no
  benefit for doing so with regard to the evaluation.
 
> A new method, check(Mapping), has also been added to the Oracle
  so that systems that use the method above can communicate with
  the Oracle in a consistent manner, when they want to query
  about individual mappings. The old methods, check(String,String,
  String) and check(String,String,Relation) are still available
  for the sake of compatibility.

> [Internal] We have added a safety check to the Oracle's
  "startSuite", "startTask", "endSuite", and "endTask" methods.
  These methods are public because the Client class must use them
  to interact with the Oracle, but they are not meant to be
  called by any source other than the Client class. As such, the
  methods now verify whether they have indeed been called by the
  Client class, and abort the Client's execution otherwise.


*** Changes from version 5 (OAEI 2014) ***

> Interactive matching is now activated through "-i <errorRate>"
  which is available in both the "-x" and the "-o" modes. In the
  latter, you must pass an input alignment as well to activate
  interactive matching. Having the "interactive" keyord in the
  reference alignment metadata is now irrelevant as far as the
  Client is concerned.

> The Oracle can now return erroneous results, with probability
  given by the errorRate (which should be a double between 0 and 1).

> In order to enable a suitable evaluation in interactive mode due
  to the introduction of errors, the Client now computes both the
  "real" evaluation of the tool and its evaluation in relation to
  the alignment resulting from the Oracle's errors applied to the
  reference alignment.

> Furthermore, the Oracle now outputs three files listing:
    a) the full registry of calls to the Oracle in a test suite,
    including their classification (TP=True Positive, TN=True
    Negative, FP=False Positive, FN=False Negative).
    b) the time interval between consecutive calls within each task
    (in milliseconds).
    c) the performance of the Oracle within each task of the suite
    plus the global classification (Total Requests, TP, TN, FP, FN,
    Precision and Negative Precision).

> The Oracle.check method now receives the mapping relation in
  String form ("=",">","<") rather than as an Oracle.Relation

> Mappings with a "?" as mapping relation in the reference
  alignment are now ignored during evaluation (they are neither
  counted as positives nor as negatives, but rather are treated
  as if they didn't exist in both the reference and the tool's
  alignment). This was the evaluation strategy used in 2014 for
  the LargeBio track, which is now global since it doesn't
  conflict with any of the other tracks.

> For the reason above, the Oracle.check method will always return
  true when the queried mapping exists with a "?" in the reference
  alignment, but the request will be ignored for all purposes
  except for measuring the time interval between queries (it will
  not be registered nor count towards the Oracle's performance).

> The "-xx" a.k.a. "suitestore" option was merged with the "-x"
  option. You can now activate it by adding "-s <resultsId>
  <toolName>" at the end of the "-x" options.

> [Internal] A HashMap based data structured is now used to store
  alignments internally as well as to evaluate them. This greatly
  increases the efficiency of the Oracle and of the alignment
  evaluation procedure, and enables the customization of evaluation
  criteria (such as the evaluation according to the Oracle-error
  reference or the evaluation excluding "?" mappings)

> [Internal] The reference alignment is now loaded a single time
  (previously it was loaded separately by Oracle and Client),
  before the match method is called and the tool's execution clock
  starts ticking.

> [Internal] Thanks to the two changes above, in interactive mode
  the tool's execution time is now almost strictly the tool's
  execution time (there is no longer the alignment loading time
  involved, and the Oracle queries are now nearly instantaneous).

> [Internal] The Oracle is now self-contained and no longer
  requests info from the Client. Comunication occurs only in the
  Client>Oracle direction, and all the Oracle receives as input
  are a reference alignment and a folder where to store the output
  files.

> [Internal] The Oracle.Relation enum is now in a separate file
  as it is used by the HashAlignment as well.

> [Internal] Exception handling was uniformized throughout both
  Client and Oracle, though addhering to the same phylosophy as
  before: unless something *really bad* happens, the Client will
  continue executing to the extent that is possible.
